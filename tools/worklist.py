"""Turn a training cycle's measurements into a ranked list of things to fix.

## Why this exists

A training cycle produces a lot of numbers and no instructions. Somebody --
a person, or a Claude session opening this repository weeks from now with no
memory of the last one -- then has to read all of it and work out what to do.
That step is where the work stalls, and it is the step a machine can do.

So this reads what the cycle just measured and writes a queue: the highest-
value thing to fix first, with the evidence for why it is first, in an order
that reflects what has actually paid off. Every real defect found so far came
from one of these six checks, in roughly this order of yield.

Run it after a cycle:

    python tools/worklist.py --out training/WORKLIST.md

It never changes a rule. It decides nothing. It only says where to look, so
that the next session starts from a question instead of from a pile of tables.

## The six checks, and why each one is here

1. CRITICAL OR HIGH ON WELL-MAINTAINED CODE. The strongest signal there is.
   A critical is what turns somebody's build red, so one on good code is worth
   more attention than a hundred low-severity notes. Three real defects came
   out of this check in a single afternoon, including a critical, high-
   confidence "leaked private key" finding that was pointing at three literal
   dots in a documentation example.

2. A SEVERITY THE MEASUREMENT DOES NOT SUPPORT. A security rule that fires no
   harder on deliberately broken code than on working code is describing a
   coding style, not detecting a defect, and should not be moving anybody's
   grade.

3. A RULE WITH NO CONTROLS. The dangerous state, because it looks perfect. A
   rule with measured recall and no controls could be firing on absolutely
   everything and every number would still read 1.0000. Six rules were in that
   state at once.

4. A RULE NOTHING HAS EVER EXERCISED. It fired on none of the corpus and has
   no injection trials, so nothing is known about it in either direction. It
   is an assertion wearing the costume of a measurement.

5. A STACK WITH NO BROKEN COUNTERPART. If a language appears only in
   well-maintained repositories, its rules cannot be measured at all -- there
   is nothing to compare against. Eight of thirteen languages were in this
   state, and closing it is what surfaced the three criticals in check 1.

6. TOO LITTLE EVIDENCE TO JUDGE. Not a defect: a gap. These rules need more
   or more varied code before any verdict about them means anything.

7. REAL-WORLD FIX PAIRS WAITING FOR A VERDICT. A commit where a maintainer
   changed code a rule fired on, after which it stopped firing. The only
   evidence in the system the tool did not generate for itself.

8. CONTESTED FINDINGS. Two analyzers, same line, different conclusions.
   Exactly one is wrong, so a verdict there is worth more than twenty on
   findings everyone already agrees about.
