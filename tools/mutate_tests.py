"""Put each defect back and check the test that should catch it does.

A test suite that has never failed is not evidence. Every test in
`tests/test_invariants.py`, `tests/test_metamorphic.py` and
`tests/test_measurement.py` was written against a defect this project
actually shipped, and the claim each one makes is "this cannot come back".
That claim is only worth something if the test still fails when the defect
returns.

So this reintroduces each one -- a small, surgical edit to a source file --
runs the single test that names it, and requires a failure. A mutation that
survives means the test is decoration: it passes whether the code is right or
not, and it would have passed on the day the bug shipped.

`tools/integrity.py` does the same thing for the claim invariants. This is
that idea applied to the rest.

    python tools/mutate_tests.py            # every mutation
    python tools/mutate_tests.py --list     # what it would run

Source files are restored on the way out, including after a crash or a
Ctrl-C. Nothing here writes to the knowledge ledger.
