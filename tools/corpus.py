"""Run Arbiter across a corpus of repositories and summarize signal vs noise.

The corpus deliberately mixes three populations:

  * "vulnerable" — repositories built to be insecure on purpose. A high finding
    count here is the correct answer.
  * "clean" — well-maintained production code. Almost every finding here is
    noise, so this is the group the rules are tuned against. A rule that fires
    on `requests` or `flask` is telling you about the rule, not about the code.
  * "examples" — collections of teaching samples and starter templates
    (reference CloudFormation stacks, CDK samples, Helm charts). These are a
    third thing and must not be counted as either of the first two. They are
    written to be short and readable rather than production-ready, so they
    genuinely lack resource limits, security contexts and pinned versions. A
    finding here is usually correct about the file and useless as a measure of
    false-positive rate. Mixing them into "clean" made the noise rate look
    roughly four times worse than it is: 2,211 of 2,904 clean findings came
    from five example repositories.
