"""Mine real before/after pairs from repository history.

## The only ground truth the tool did not generate for itself

Everything else Arbiter measures against, it made. Injection plants faults from
patterns somebody chose and scores the rules against controls drawn from the
same generator: excellent evidence that a rule works mechanically, no evidence
at all about code in the wild. Corpus discrimination compares two populations
that were also chosen. Both are worth having and both share a blind spot, which
is that a rule can pass every one of them while being wrong about real code.

A commit is different. Somebody who knew the system decided something needed
changing and changed it. Nobody wrote it to be found by a scanner.

So: walk a repository's history, scan each commit and its parent, and look for
a finding that is present in the parent and gone in the child at the same site.
That transition is a candidate real-world fix, and it is the strongest single
piece of evidence a rule can have:

  * the rule fired on code a maintainer later judged worth changing, and
  * it stopped firing once they changed it.

A rule that fires on both sides of a commit that plainly fixed the thing is
wrong, and nothing else in the pipeline would have told you.

## Why commit messages are not used as the filter

The obvious version greps commit messages for "fix", "security", "encrypt".
That was tried first and it is a bad filter in both directions. Library
repositories are full of feature commits that say "encryption" and fix nothing;
real remediations are routinely committed as "update manifests" or "address
review comments". Filtering on the message finds the commits somebody wrote a
tidy message for, which is not the same set.

Walking transitions instead needs no vocabulary and no assumption about how
teams write messages. The finding appearing and then disappearing IS the
signal.

## What a pair proves, and what it does not

A transition is a *candidate*. Findings also disappear because the file was
deleted, renamed, or moved wholesale, and none of those are fixes. Deletions
and renames are filtered out here, but the remainder still needs a person to
confirm the change addressed the finding rather than removing the code around
it. So pairs land in the adjudication queue rather than straight into the
ledger — the same rule the rest of the tool follows: a machine may find the
candidate, a person decides what it means.

Once confirmed, a pair becomes a permanent regression case: this rule MUST
fire on this commit and MUST NOT fire on its successor, forever.
