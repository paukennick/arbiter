#   1. makes sure the practice repositories are downloaded
#   2. runs every rule against them and records what it found
#   3. measures whether each rule tells good code from broken code
#   4. plants known faults and checks the rules catch them
#   5. checks the tool never claims something it didn't actually check
#   6. runs the test suite, then writes training/WORKLIST.md -- what to look
#      at next, and why
#   7. optionally saves the results back to the repo
#
# It measures. It never edits a rule. Deciding what a result means is the part
# that needs judgement, and WORKLIST.md is the handoff to whoever does that.
