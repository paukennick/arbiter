# Install the external analyzers Arbiter wraps, at pinned versions.
#
# Why this file exists
# --------------------
# The adapters were written, shipped, and never once run end to end, because
# getting the five tools installed was a manual step nobody had written down.
# When they were finally installed by hand, checkov alone contributed 477
# findings on a single repository -- more than three times everything the
# native probes found.
#
# A missing analyzer is not an error here. Arbiter records it as "not assessed"
# with the binary named, and the coverage figure drops accordingly, which is
# the whole point of the coverage model. So this script reports what it got and
# what it did not, and always exits 0. A failed install must not fail a build;
# it must show up honestly in the next report.
#
# Versions are pinned because an analyzer that changes underneath you changes
# your findings, and Arbiter's determinism guarantee covers its own inputs.
# Bump them deliberately, then re-run tools/calibrate_external.py -- the
# measured severities are keyed to check ids that a new version may add to,
# rename, or drop.
#
# Nothing here is bundled with Arbiter -- each tool is fetched from its own
# upstream (PyPI or a GitHub release) at install time. Redistributing the
# binaries themselves is a separate, unresolved question (docs/licensing.md,
# requirement L-6), so this script stays on the safe side of it: it only ever
# drives the operator's own install of someone else's tool.
#
#   ./tools/install_tools.sh              # everything, no prompts (CI/scripted)
#   ./tools/install_tools.sh checkov      # just one, no prompt
#   ./tools/install_tools.sh -y           # everything, skip the confirm prompt
#
# Run with no arguments at an interactive terminal and it asks which of the
# five to install and then asks you to confirm before touching anything.
# Pass -y/--yes to skip that confirmation (selection by name still works).
