"""Assign severities to a third-party tool's checks by measuring them.

## The problem

Checkov's open build reports `"severity": null` on every finding. So does
bandit's per-test confidence in practice, and gitleaks has no notion of
severity at all. Arbiter's adapter manifests papered over this with
`severity_const = "medium"`, which means a scan of one Terraform repository
produced 477 findings of identical weight, and no way to tell the two that
matter from the 475 that do not.

Everybody's answer to this is a hand-written severity table -- somebody's
opinion, written once, never revisited. Arbiter already has the machinery to
do better, because it has two populations of real code and a way to ask
whether a check fires harder on the broken one.

## What this does

Runs the external tools across the corpus, and for every individual check they
emit -- every `CKV_AWS_*`, every bandit `B*`, every gitleaks rule -- computes
the same weighted discrimination ratio used for native rules, then writes a
severity table keyed by check id.

    ratio        assigned severity   reading
    ---------    -----------------   --------------------------------------
    >= 10x       medium              clearly discriminating
    >= 3x        low                 discriminating, but common enough in
                                     working code to be worth downgrading
    < 3x         info                does not separate the populations;
                                     reported at zero weight
    no data      unchanged           never seen on either population, so no
                                     claim is made

## Why this does not break the determinism guarantee

Arbiter's standing rule is that learning adjusts confidence and never
severity, because a severity that drifts silently makes a gate meaningless.
That rule is intact here, and the distinction matters:

  * For a native rule, severity is a deliberate policy statement, and this
    tool does not touch it.
  * For an external check, the tool supplied NO severity. Arbiter was
    inventing `medium` for all of them. Replacing an invented constant with a
    measured one is not drift.

The table is written into the knowledge file, versioned with it, and recorded
in every report that uses it -- so `(commit, config, knowledge_version)` still
produces identical bytes, and `--pin-knowledge` still fails a run if the table
moved underneath it.

## What this cannot tell you

Whether a check is CORRECT. A check that fires only on broken code might still
be flagging the wrong line for the wrong reason. Discrimination says the check
carries signal, not that the signal means what the check's title claims. That
distinction is why adjudication by a person is still the thing calibration
actually reads.

# A check needs to have been seen this many times before a ratio computed from

# nothing, which is the honest answer rather than a confident guess.
MIN_OBSERVATIONS = 5

# ...and seen in this many distinct repositories before it may be PROMOTED
# above "low". One repository is not a population.
#
# This rail exists because the first version of this tool promoted "Ensure
# every security group and rule has a description" to HIGH. The measurement
# was arithmetically correct and completely wrong: Terragoat is the only
# repository in the corpus with many security groups, and it does not write
# descriptions, so the check scored infinite discrimination on a sample of
# one. A demotion from a thin sample costs little; a promotion from one
# repository puts a documentation-hygiene check on the same footing as a
# public S3 bucket.
MIN_REPOS_TO_PROMOTE = 2

# ratio -> severity. Deliberately coarse: the measurement does not support
# finer distinctions, and pretending otherwise is how severity tables become
# fiction.
#
# Note the ceiling. Measurement CANNOT promote a check to "high", and the
# reason is a distinction worth stating plainly: discrimination measures
# SIGNAL -- how much more often a check fires on broken code than on working
# code -- while severity is supposed to encode CONSEQUENCE, which is how much
# it matters when the check is right. The two correlate and they are not the
# same quantity.
#
# The example that forced this: "Ensure every security group and rule has a
# description" fires 33 times on deliberately broken Terraform and zero times
# on the well-maintained Terraform modules, which are meticulous about
# descriptions. The ratio is real, reproducible, and stack-matched. It is also
# not a security finding, and grading it "high" would put a missing comment on
# the same footing as a public S3 bucket.
#
# So measurement is allowed to say "this carries signal" (up to medium) and
# "this carries no signal" (info, zero weight). It is not allowed to
# manufacture a claim about consequence out of a signal measurement. A check
# reaches "high" only when the tool that owns it says so -- and checkov's open
# build says nothing at all, which is what started this.
