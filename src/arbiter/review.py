"""Batch adjudication: making the one irreplaceable input cheap enough to give.

## Why this is the bottleneck

Calibration reads one ledger and one only: findings a person looked at and
judged right or wrong. Not the injection trials, which measure whether a rule
works mechanically against faults the tool itself generated. Not the corpus
discrimination, which measures whether a rule separates broken code from
working code. Those are both worth having and neither answers the question
calibration asks, which is whether the things this rule flags are things you
would actually act on.

No schedule can supply that. No amount of nightly running produces it. It is
the one input that has to come from a person, and at the time of writing the
ledger had exactly zero entries -- which means the calibration machinery, in a
tool built around calibration, was doing nothing at all.

The reason was not unwillingness. It was that adjudicating meant copying
fingerprints out of a report one at a time:

    arbiter feedback f:8c41d2ae9b07 --false-positive
    arbiter feedback f:9d02a11bc433 --true-positive

Twenty of those is an afternoon of clerical work, so it never happened. This
module exists to turn twenty adjudications into a few minutes of reading.

## Sampling, and why it is not random

Twenty adjudicated observations is the threshold at which a rule stops being
reported as unproven. That number is what the sampler optimizes for, not
coverage of the finding list:

  1. Rules already close to twenty come first. Getting one rule from fifteen
     to twenty is worth more than one observation each on five rules, because
     the first crosses a threshold and the second crosses nothing.
  2. Then rules with the most findings, because a rule that fires often is one
     whose precision matters most.
  3. Within a rule, findings are spread across files rather than taken in
     order, so twenty samples of the same mistake in one file do not get
     mistaken for twenty independent observations.
  4. Findings already adjudicated never reappear. One disputed finding must
     not be able to move the statistics as many times as somebody clicks.

A flat random sample would spend most of its budget on whatever rule happens
to fire most, which is usually the least interesting one.

Marking honestly matters more than marking everything. A skipped finding costs
nothing; a wrong mark is worse than no mark, because calibration reads this
ledger and nothing else.

A rule needs {min_obs} adjudications before it stops being reported as unproven.
The selection below is weighted toward rules that are close to that line.
