"""One service layer, two front doors.

## Why this exists separately from the front doors

Arbiter is growing a second caller. The MCP surface lets an agent run a scan on
a machine where Arbiter is already installed; the hosted API lets a caller run
one where it is not. Those differ only in transport. Everything that matters --
where output may be written, whether the network is reachable, whether the
scanned tree is ever executed, and what the caller is forbidden to do -- is
identical, and a rule written twice is a rule that will eventually be written
differently.

So the containment lives here and the front doors are thin.

## The operation that does not exist

There is no function here that records an adjudication verdict, and the hosted
surface must never grow one.

Calibration reads a single ledger: findings a person looked at and judged.
Injection trials measure whether a rule fires against faults Arbiter generated
itself, and corpus discrimination measures whether a rule separates broken code
from working code -- both are Arbiter measuring Arbiter. The adjudication ledger
is the one signal in the system the system did not generate, and
`learn.record()` refuses to re-adjudicate a fingerprint, so a wrong verdict is
permanent.

An automated caller marking verdicts in a loop would convert measured precision
into the tool's opinion of itself, at machine speed and irreversibly. So
`review_queue` writes a queue with every mark blank and stops there. A person
marks it and runs `arbiter review --apply` locally.

## Custody, which is the part hosting actually changes

Running the scan somewhere the customer does not control means their source
lives, however briefly, on someone else's disk. Three consequences are designed
for rather than assumed away:

  * A workspace is created outside the server's own tree, is readable only by
    the process that made it, and is removed when the scan ends -- including
    when it fails.
  * Uploaded archives are treated as hostile input. A member that is absolute,
    escapes the extraction root, is a link, is a device node, or is
    implausibly large is refused rather than written. Python's `tarfile` grew a
    `data` filter that does most of this, but only in 3.12, and this package
    supports 3.11.
  * Reports are sensitive even after redaction. `report.py` already refuses to
    reprint a secret's value -- `test_no_output_format_reprints_a_secret` holds
    it to that -- but a report still names the file and the kind of credential,
    which is a map to what to steal. Retention is therefore the caller's
    decision to make explicitly, not a default this layer picks.

## Why it shells out

`run_scan` takes fifteen parameters and `arbiter/__init__.py` exports only
`__version__`, so there is no stable Python API to bind a service to yet.
Shelling out to the console script also keeps each scan in its own process: a
probe that wedges or dies takes down a subprocess, not the server.
