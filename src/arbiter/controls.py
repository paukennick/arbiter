"""Control frameworks, and an honest account of what was actually assessed.

## The problem with every compliance report

A compliance scanner runs some checks, maps them to control identifiers, and
produces a page of green ticks. What it almost never tells you is the size of
what it did not look at. Two different silences get collapsed into the same
green:

  * the control was checked and passed, and
  * the control was never checked at all, by anything.

An accreditation package built on that is worse than no package, because a
reader cannot tell which controls carry evidence.

## The five states

Arbiter refuses to collapse them. Every control in a framework pack resolves
to exactly one of five states, and a report says how many are in each:

  SATISFIED      A check covering this control ran, applied to something, and
                 found nothing. Evidence exists.
  VIOLATED       A check covering this control fired. Evidence exists.
  NOT_ASSESSED   A check covers this control on paper, but it did not run
                 here -- the tool was not installed, the value was unknown
                 until apply, the stack was absent. NOT a pass.
  NO_COVERAGE    The control is technically assessable in principle, and
                 Arbiter has no check for it. This is the honest gap, and it
                 is the number that should be read first.
  NOT_AUTOMATABLE
                 No static analyzer can ever assess this control, because it
                 is about people, paperwork or physical space. Personnel
                 screening, incident-response exercises, visitor logs. Listing
                 these as failures is as dishonest as listing them as passes;
                 they belong to a human assessor and the pack says so.

The last two are the ones that make the report usable. A tool that reports
"87% compliant" without separating them is reporting its own coverage as if
it were your security posture.

## Independent packs, not crosswalks

Each framework pack maps its own controls directly to checks. Nothing is
routed through a hub framework. Crosswalking -- mapping 800-171 to 800-53 and
then 800-53 to checks -- is convenient and quietly lossy: the second hop
inherits the first hop's approximations, and a control ends up claiming
evidence two translations removed from anything that ran. The cost of
independence is duplicated mapping work. The benefit is that a claim about
CMMC is a claim about CMMC.

## Baseline totals

A pack states how many controls its framework actually has, separately from
how many the pack enumerates. Without that, a pack containing the twenty
controls Arbiter happens to cover would report 100% coverage. With it, the
report says twenty of three hundred and twenty-three, which is the truth.
