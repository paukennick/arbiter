"""Is the checking switched on?

## The question nobody asks

Every other dimension in this tool asks whether the code is sound. This one
asks whether the *checking* is — and it exists because a clean report has two
possible causes that look identical from the outside:

  * the analyzers ran over everything and found nothing, or
  * large parts of the tree were excluded, hundreds of findings were silenced
    by inline comments, and the tests that would have caught a regression
    assert nothing.

Every scanner on the market will hand you the same green tick for both. They
have to: they honour the suppression comments, they honour the ignore files,
and a test that asserts nothing still passes. The silencing is invisible to
the thing being silenced.

Measured across ten corpus repositories: 445 suppression comments, 169 of them
in a single project. Not one appears in any tool's output.

## Why these are not defects, and must not be scored

A repository with four hundred `# noqa` comments is not insecure. It is
*unmeasured*, which is a different thing and needs saying differently. So the
assurance dimension carries weight zero in the scorecard: its findings are
reported, counted and never folded into a grade. They belong to the same
family as "not assessed" — statements about the evidence rather than about
the system.

This also means the usual discrimination test does not apply. Suppressions are
far more common in mature, well-maintained code than in a deliberately broken
teaching app, so measured against the vulnerable corpus these rules would look
like noise. They are not: nobody writes a repository that is deliberately
badly suppressed, so there is no broken population to compare against, exactly
as with the quality and drift rules. `tools/discriminate.py` already declines
to issue a verdict for dimensions in that position.

## What is checked

1. SILENCED FINDINGS. Every mainstream analyzer's inline ignore syntax, across
   eleven languages. Counted per tool, with the blanket ones — an ignore that
   names no specific rule, and so silences everything on that line or in that
   file — separated out, because a bare `# noqa` is a different act from
   `# noqa: E501`.

2. EXCLUDED CODE. Ignore files and analyzer configuration that remove parts of
   the tree from analysis. A `.semgrepignore` covering `src/` means the
   semgrep result in your CI is about the tests.

3. TESTS THAT CANNOT FAIL. Permanently skipped tests, and test functions whose
   body contains no assertion of any kind. Both pass forever. This is also the
   only thing in the tool that speaks to SSDF PW.8 with any force — the
   existing check merely notes whether test files exist.

Nothing here is inferred. Every finding cites a line you can open.
