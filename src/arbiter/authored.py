"""Defects characteristic of machine-authored code.

## Why this is its own probe

A large and growing share of new code is drafted by a language model, and
model-drafted code fails in ways human-drafted code mostly does not. The
failures are not subtle bugs in tricky logic; they are confident, fluent,
plausible-looking code that refers to things which do not exist.

The awkward part is that a model is the worst available reviewer for this.
Asked to check its own output for hallucinated imports, it reads the import,
finds it plausible — it generated it precisely because it was plausible — and
passes. These failures are, however, almost all *decidable*: a package is
either in the manifest or it is not, a function either returns a real value or
a hardcoded one. So they belong in a deterministic probe, not in the
judgement pass.

## What is checked

1. IMPORTS OF PACKAGES NOTHING DECLARES. A third-party module imported by the
   code, absent from every dependency manifest in the repository, and not in
   the standard library. Usually a stale manifest; sometimes a package that
   does not exist at all, which is worse than a broken build because the name
   is now available for somebody else to register and publish. That attack has
   a name -- slopsquatting -- and the only defence is noticing before the
   install.

2. STUBS ON PRODUCTION PATHS. `return True  # TODO`, `raise NotImplementedError`,
   `pass` as a whole function body, a hardcoded return where a lookup belongs.
   Fine in a scaffold, quietly catastrophic when the function is named
   `verify_signature`.

3. SECURITY CHECKS TURNED OFF. `verify=False`, `rejectUnauthorized: false`,
   `InsecureSkipVerify: true`, `strict: False`, disabled host-key checking.
   Frequently generated to make an example work and then never removed.

4. PROSE THAT DESCRIBES ABSENT CODE. A docstring or comment promising
   validation, retry, caching or authentication in a body that does none of
   it. Reported narrowly and at low confidence, because a comment can be right
   about intent and wrong about the current state without being a defect.

## What this is not

Not a style checker, and not an attempt to detect whether a model wrote the
code. Provenance is unknowable from the text and does not matter: a hardcoded
`return True` in `verify_token` is the same defect whoever typed it. The
patterns are simply weighted toward the failures that became common when
drafting got cheap.
