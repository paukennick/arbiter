"""Declarative adapters for external analyzers.

An adapter is a TOML manifest: how to invoke a tool, how to parse it, and how
to map its output onto Finding. No Python is written per tool, which is what
keeps the long tail of languages tractable.

A tool that is not installed is not a failure. The adapter reports `skipped`
with the missing binary named, and the coverage figure drops accordingly.
