"""The model-backed judgement pass.

## What a model is for here, and what it is not for

Everything else in Arbiter answers questions with a definite shape: is this
property set, does this value match this pattern, does this address appear in
two repositories with different values. A model is worth adding only for the
questions that have no such shape -- whether the README describes behaviour the
code no longer has, whether a comment and the function beneath it disagree,
whether a variable named `temp_fix_DO_NOT_SHIP` is still shipping.

It is emphatically not here to re-find secrets or misconfigurations. Those have
deterministic answers, and swapping a decidable check for a probabilistic one
is a downgrade dressed as an upgrade.

## Three rules this pass obeys

**1. Inferred findings never blend with deterministic ones.** Every finding
from this pass carries `provenance="inferred"`, and the gate ignores inferred
findings unless `gate.gate_inferred` is explicitly set. A model's opinion can
inform a person; it should not turn somebody's build red on its own.

**2. No provider configured is NOT-ASSESSED, never a pass.** This is the rule
the whole file exists to protect. The easy implementation returns an empty list
when there is no API key, and an empty list is indistinguishable from "the
model looked and found nothing". Every scan without a provider would then
quietly report clean documentation drift. So the probe raises `Unavailable`,
the engine records `skipped` with the reason, and the coverage figure drops by
exactly the amount that was not checked.

**3. The model never sees more than it needs, and never runs the code.** Only
file excerpts are sent, secrets are masked before sending, and the response is
parsed as data. A model cannot be allowed to name a file path that was never
in the request -- see `_reconcile`.

## Determinism

A model is not reproducible in the way the rest of the tool is, and pretending
otherwise would be worse than admitting it. Two mitigations, both partial and
both stated in the report rather than hidden:

  * temperature 0 and a pinned model id, recorded in the outcome, so a run is
    as repeatable as the provider allows;
  * inferred findings excluded from the gate by default, so irreproducibility
    cannot change a pass/fail outcome without somebody opting in.

The `offline` and `ci` profiles forbid model calls outright. That is the
setting to use when reproducibility must be absolute.
