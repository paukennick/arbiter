"""The hosted front door: Arbiter as something a customer calls, not installs.

This is the second surface over `service.py`, alongside `mcp.py`. It decides
nothing about containment -- workspaces, archive safety, path limits and profile
limits all live in the service layer, so they are written once.

What belongs here instead is everything that only matters when the caller is
remote and unknown: who they are, how much they may send, and what is kept
afterwards.

## Access is handed out by hand, one key per user

There is no sign-up, no billing and no self-service, and nothing here charges
anybody. The owner mints a key with `arbiter api key add --user "..."` and sends
it to somebody he knows. Issuing by hand is how access works because there is no
identity or billing system to do it any other way -- not a vetting step, and not
something a recipient has to justify. Nobody is asked what they intend to scan.

The side effect is worth keeping: something that cannot be signed up for cannot
be used at scale by a stranger.

A key is scoped to a user, and that is the whole model -- no roles, no tiers, no
per-key permissions. One user holds at most one live key, so a key identifies a
person rather than a pool. Sharing one defeats every limit here: the caps below
count per key, and revoking a shared key for the person who left also cuts off
the person who stayed. Adding somebody means minting them their own.

Keys are stored as SHA-256 hashes, never in the clear. The raw key is shown once
at mint time and cannot be recovered -- so the key file is not itself a
credential store, and losing it means reissuing rather than a breach. Each key
carries a short id derived from its hash so a key can be named in a log or
revoked without anyone writing the secret down.

## Nothing is kept

A scan writes into a workspace that is deleted when the request ends, including
when it fails. The report goes back in the response body and nowhere else. There
is no database, no object store, no log of findings.

That costs a feature: a caller cannot come back tomorrow for yesterday's report.
It buys the simplest possible answer to "what do you hold of ours?", which is
"nothing", and that answer needs no retention policy to defend.

The reason it matters more here than it would for most services: a report names
the file a credential sits in and what kind it is. `report.py` withholds the
secret's value -- `test_no_output_format_reprints_a_secret` holds it to that --
but a stored report would still be a map of where to look. Keeping none is
cheaper than guarding them.

One thing is kept, and it is about the caller rather than the code: a line per
request saying which key called, which operation, how it ended, how many bytes
arrived and how long it took. That is what answers "who ran what, and when"
after a key leaks or a bill is disputed. It holds no file name, no finding and
no fragment of the upload, because a log that quoted findings would rebuild on
disk, permanently, the thing the request path takes care to delete.

## Source arrives as an upload, and only as an upload

The server does not clone from a caller's repository, because that would mean
holding credentials to their source: a far larger thing to ask for and to
protect than a tarball for the duration of one request. Uploads are treated as
hostile input by `service.extract_archive`.

## No verdict crosses this boundary

`review_queue` returns a queue with every mark blank, exactly as the other
surfaces do. There is no endpoint that records an adjudication, and there must
never be one: `learn.record()` refuses to re-adjudicate a fingerprint, so a mark
made by an automated caller would be permanent and would replace the one signal
in the system that the system did not generate.

Whether a customer's own human adjudications should ever feed calibration is an
open question and is deliberately not answered here. If it is ever answered yes,
the thing sent back is the verdict and the rule id -- never the fingerprint,
which is derived from the file path and a snippet of their code and would leak
both.
