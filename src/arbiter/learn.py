"""Learning, without breaking reproducibility.

An evaluator that adapts and an evaluator that is reproducible are in direct
tension: if a scan's behaviour depends on history, the same commit can pass on
Monday and fail on Tuesday, and a baseline, a CI gate and an accreditation
artefact all stop meaning anything.

The resolution is to separate the two:

  * LEARNING is offline. Feedback, measured precision and per-repository
    distributions accumulate into a knowledge file.
  * EXECUTION is deterministic. A scan reads one pinned knowledge version and
    records its hash in the report. Two runs against the same commit and the
    same knowledge version produce identical bytes.

So the tool adapts between runs, deliberately and visibly, rather than
drifting underneath you. Three further limits keep the adaptation honest:

  1. Learning adjusts CONFIDENCE, never SEVERITY. How sure we are is
     measurable from feedback; how much a defect matters is a judgement that
     belongs to the policy file.
  2. Learning never changes a gate outcome unless `gate.use_calibration` is
     explicitly set.
  3. A rule with too few observations reports as unproven rather than
     inheriting a flattering estimate from a handful of samples.
