# Configuration

`arbiter.yaml` at the repository root is the whole configuration surface. There
is no second config file, no environment-variable override matrix, and no
implicit user-level defaults.

## The file

```yaml
version: 1
profile: offline          # offline | ci | connected | audit

gate:
  fail_on:
    severity: critical    # any critical fails the build
    new: high             # new highs fail; pre-existing ones don't
    coverage_below: 0.60  # refuse to certify a thin scan
  gate_on_inferred: false

suppress:
  - rule: "arbiter/quality.no-tests"
    reason: "tests live in a sibling repository"
    expires: 2027-01-31   # expiry is mandatory

rules:
  - id: code-note-anchors
    type: reference_integrity
    refs:    { files: "**/*.py", pattern: "#\\s*note:\\s*(?P<ref>[\\w./#-]+)" }
    anchors: { files: ".ai/code-notes/**/*.md", pattern: "^#+\\s*(?P<anchor>.+)$" }
    severity: high
```

## Profiles

A profile is a capability budget, not a severity setting.

| Profile | Network | Model | For |
|---|---|---|---|
| `offline` | no | no | air-gapped and high-side environments |
| `ci` | no | no | fast, deterministic gating |
| `connected` | yes | yes | full depth |
| `audit` | yes | yes | everything, no time budget |

A probe that needs a capability the profile forbids is skipped with that reason
recorded, so the report says what the profile cost you. Coverage falls by
exactly the amount that was not checked — the grade never quietly absorbs it.

Override per run with `arbiter scan . --profile connected`.

## Gating

```yaml
gate:
  fail_on:
    severity: critical
    new: high
    coverage_below: 0.60
  gate_on_inferred: false
  use_calibration: false
```

| Key | Effect |
|---|---|
| `severity` | any finding at or above this severity fails |
| `new` | findings at or above this severity that are absent from the baseline fail |
| `coverage_below` | the run fails if rubric coverage falls below this fraction |
| `gate_on_inferred` | when false (default), findings with `provenance: inferred` never fail a build |
| `use_calibration` | when false (default), learned confidence never changes a gate outcome |

`coverage_below` is the guard against a reassuring result from a scan that
barely ran. Without it, uninstalling an analyzer looks identical to fixing every
finding it produced.

## Suppressions

```yaml
suppress:
  - rule: "arbiter/*"
    path: "fixtures/**"
    reason: "planted defects — this is the golden-fixture test corpus"
    expires: 2099-01-01
```

Three properties, each deliberate:

- **`reason` and `expires` are mandatory.** An expired suppression stops
  suppressing rather than failing the run, so the finding returns and is
  re-decided instead of quietly persisting forever.
- **Suppressed findings stay in the report**, marked and attributed. They are
  not deleted; a reader can always see what was set aside and on whose say-so.
- **Patterns match rule and path**, including external rules
  (`checkov/*`), so a third-party analyzer can be quieted in one place.

## House rules

Five rule types cover repository-specific policy without writing code:

| Type | Asserts |
|---|---|
| `file_exists` | a required file is present |
| `file_absent` | a forbidden file is not present |
| `content_match` | a pattern is present, or forbidden, in matching files |
| `reference_integrity` | every reference resolves to a declared anchor |
| `metric_threshold` | a measured metric stays within a limit |

Plus `ast_query`, which runs a tree-sitter query and reports the captures —
structural, so it catches the construct however it is formatted:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: no-bare-except
    type: ast_query
    languages: [python]
    files: "src/**/*.py"
    query: "(except_clause) @hit"
    title: "Bare or broad except clause"
    remediation: "Catch the specific exception, or re-raise after handling."
    severity: low
```

`ast_query` requires the `ast` extra (tree-sitter). Without it the rule reports
as not assessed, naming the missing dependency.

## Adaptive thresholds

Thresholds can adapt to the repository rather than to history, which needs no
knowledge file and preserves reproducibility:

```yaml
quality:
  adaptive: true
  max_file_lines: 900       # the floor, still enforced
  max_function_lines: 140
```

File length, function length and complexity limits are drawn from that
codebase's own p95, with a floor so a uniformly bad codebase cannot normalize
its way to a clean report:

```text
file_lines      n=30   median=143  p95=795
function_lines  n=210  median=12   p95=75     # the fixed 120 limit was too lax here
complexity      n=210  median=5.5  p95=27
```

A distribution with fewer than 30 samples is ignored and the fixed threshold
stands.

## Where state lives

| Path | Contents | Commit it? |
|---|---|---|
| `arbiter.yaml` | configuration | yes |
| `.arbiter/baseline.json` | accepted current state | yes |
| `.arbiter/knowledge.json` | calibration ledgers and learned confidence | yes |
| `.arbiter/external-severity.json` | measured severities for external checks | yes |
| `arbiter-out/` | reports from the last run | no — git-ignored |
| `arbiter-ab/` | A/B harness output | no — git-ignored |
