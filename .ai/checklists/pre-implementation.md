# Pre-Implementation Checklist

- Requirement ID confirmed or proposed.
- Requirement quality checked when the task changes product behavior.
- Design quality checked when the task changes structure or interfaces.
- Engineering management checklist considered for broad or multi-step work.
- Process tailoring checklist considered when workflow choice matters.
- Model/method checklist considered when adding diagrams or formal models.
- Economics decision checklist considered when cost, value, or tradeoff matters.
- Computing, mathematical, or engineering foundations checklist considered when
  the task depends on those assumptions.
- Minimum access scope stated.
- `.ai/project-map.md` read before broad traversal, or updated by hand when
  stale or missing (`./omni map` is intentionally never run here — see
  `.ai/project-configuration.md`).
- `.ai/.ignore` exclusions respected.
- `.cursorignore`, `.gitignore`, or equivalent tool ignore files checked when
  the assistant or IDE supports them.
- Prompt includes known requirement ID, framework, language, constraints, and
  desired outcome.
- Outline requested or produced before broad, risky, or high-token
  implementation.
- Model and effort level fit the task complexity.
- Relevant rulepack selected.
- Relevant playbook selected.
- Acceptance criteria understood.
- Validation plan selected.
