## Validation Gate

This project does not do public package releases, and `./omni doctor` is
not the real validation gate here (expect false-positive FAILs for
intentionally-excluded adapters/entrypoints/legal files — see
`.ai/project-configuration.md`). Run instead:

```bash
python3 tests/validate_stacks.py
pytest tests/
```

Confirm no local session notes or secrets are staged.
