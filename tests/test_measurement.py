"""Tests for the code that judges the rules, not for the rules.

A wrong rule reports a wrong finding, and somebody notices. A wrong
*measurement* certifies the wrong rule, and nobody does -- the number it
prints is the thing you would have used to check. This project has already
been bitten there: a held-out comparison called Kubernetes findings "2.09x
worse" on held-out code, and all three causes were measurement bugs (it
matched a repository by its label rather than its content, counted findings
instead of weighting them by severity and confidence, and used one repository
per side as though that were a sample). Separately, three dependency-pinning
rules carried a hand-assigned severity until measurement showed two of them
fire *more* on good code than on bad.

So this file tests the arithmetic and the guarantees around it: the
confidence interval, the threshold that decides a rule is proven, and the
separation between what a person judged and what a generator produced.
